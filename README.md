# React Portfolio Website with Backend API Integration

## Overview

This project aims to create a dynamic portfolio website using React.js, with data retrieved from a backend API. The website will serve as a showcase of projects, skills, and contact information.

## Requirements

1. **Frontend Technology**: The website must be built using React.js to ensure a modern and interactive user experience.

2. **Backend API Integration**: Data for the website will be retrieved from a backend API. This API can be implemented using technologies like PHP or Express.js. The API endpoints will return JSON data containing information about projects, skills, and contact details.

3. **Website Content**:

   - **Portfolio Section**:
     - Display your name, desired role, and a brief introduction.
     - Showcase projects with important details such as project name, screenshots, URLs (if applicable), short blurbs about each project, and a listing of languages/technologies used.
     - Provide a way to contact you, either through contact information or a contact form.
   - **API Section**:
     - Include a section on the website to discuss the backend API, explaining its purpose, endpoints, and how it integrates with the frontend.

4. **Deployment**: The website should be deployed to a hosting service like Vercel. For a portfolio site, using a custom domain is recommended for a professional appearance.

## Implementation Details

- **Frontend**: Utilize React.js for building the frontend components, including navigation, project cards, and contact form.
- **Backend**: Implement the backend API using PHP or Express.js to serve JSON data to the frontend.
- **API Calls**: Use asynchronous API calls in React to fetch data from the backend and update the UI accordingly.
- **Styling**: Apply CSS or a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS to style the website and make it visually appealing.
- **Testing**: Conduct testing to ensure proper functionality and responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes.

## Deployment Steps

1. Develop the frontend and backend components separately.
2. Integrate the backend API endpoints into the frontend React application.
3. Test the website locally to ensure all features are working as expected.
4. Deploy the website to a hosting service like Vercel, configuring any necessary environment variables and domain settings.
5. Test the deployed website to verify that it functions correctly in a production environment.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you'll create a professional portfolio website that showcases your projects and skills, while also demonstrating your ability to integrate frontend and backend technologies effectively.
